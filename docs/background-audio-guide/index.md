    Here we assume that you already have presenation with slides ready to add audio guide to. If you don't have a presentation ready, you can create one by following the instructions in [Create Presentations](../create-presentations/index.md) section.

1. Go to the presentation listing page at *Content -> Presentations* in the admin menu.
2. Click on the title of the presentation you want to add a background audio guide to.
3. On the presentation edit page, select the **Background Audio** checkbox under *Reveal.js Plugins*. Save changes by clicking *Save and continue* button.
4. Settings for the background audio guide will appear at bottom under plugin settings.
5. There you will see *Audio File Path* field. Enter the path to the audio file you want to play as background audio. Save changes by clicking *Save and continue* button.
6. A new **Audio Sync Studio** tab would have already appeared. Open that tab.
