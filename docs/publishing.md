# Publishing Presentations

You can publish a presentation by configuring a block to display the presentation. Presentation blocks can be added to node pages by overriding the layout for that node page. Or you can add the block to a region in *Structure -> Block Layout*.

## Configuring a Presentation Block

In a presentation block, you can select any presentation to display.

!!! note
    Presentation block will not be displayed if the presentation is not enabled.
